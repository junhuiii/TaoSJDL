## General Information
This project is part of my intern work at Teng Fuh Holdings Pte. Ltd. This scraper
helps to automate the downloading process for my other project, which is to upload the
downloaded data into a sqlite database for further data analysis. This project currently being
updated, although the program already works. It has allowed me to download 400+ xls files
from [淘数据](https://taosj.com/) automatically, which saves me around 5 to 6 hours of manual work per week on average.

## Features
* Scraper uses Selenium that logs into 淘数据 and downloads the sales figures and revenues of created SKUs within the 'TaoSJ Meta' Directory.
* Links with tf-es-dumping repository which creates a backup of the files in 'tf-es-dumping(TaoSJ Data backup)' before deleting and updating the TaoSJ Data directory in tf-es-dumping repository with the new TaoSJ Data folders
